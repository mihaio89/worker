## dependency injection

When a class is registered with the dependency injection container, the container will inspect the class's constructor and attempt to resolve all of its dependencies based on the registered services in the container. If a matching service is found for a given dependency, it will be injected into the constructor of the dependent class when an instance of that class is requested.

So, any class that has a constructor parameter of IOptions<Config> can receive the Config configuration values from the dependency injection container, as long as the Config has been registered with the container beforehand.

Once a class is registered with the dependency injection container, any other classes that depend on it can have it injected into their constructors by the container. This allows for a flexible and modular architecture where classes can be easily swapped out or extended without affecting the rest of the application.


## errors

private async Task ErrorHandler(ProcessErrorEventArgs args)

args.Exception.Message is a property of the Exception object that returns only the error message of the exception. This can be useful for displaying a concise error message to a user or logging a high-level error message that doesn't require detailed diagnostic information.

args.Exception.ToString() is a method that returns a string representation of the entire exception object, including the error message, stack trace, and any inner exceptions. This can be useful for detailed diagnostic logging or debugging purposes.

In the ErrorHandler method, if you only want to log the error message, then using args.Exception.Message is appropriate. However, if you want to log the full exception details, including the stack trace, then using args.Exception.ToString() is more appropriate.


## services

The name of the class where the extension method is defined does not matter, as long as the class is in the same namespace and is marked as public static.

In the code you provided, the class is named ServiceInjector, but it could have been named anything else, such as Injector or ServiceExtensions. The important thing is that the class is marked as public static and that the extension method (Collection) is defined as a static method in the class.

When you call the extension method on an instance of the interface (IServiceCollection), the C# compiler looks for the method in all static classes in the same namespace, regardless of their names. If the method is found, it is called as an instance method on the IServiceCollection object, even though it is defined as a static method in another class.

Therefore, the name of the class where the extension method is defined is not significant, as long as it meets the requirements for defining an extension method.
